# Educational Games World
Educational mobile game studio helps instructors generate their own educational games without any coding experience. Using game templates anyone can generate any type of educational game to help children and students learn the subjects and improve themselves.

# Motivation
This project takes its motivation from these facts:
1. Children (including my daughter :)) hates doing paper based homework.
2. They love playing games.
3. There is always a war between children and parents spent time on education not on playing games.
4. Teachers must spent enormous time to check homeworks and give feedback to students. Sometimes this doesn't happen perfect.
5. Implementing a mobile game is a very hard work! Most of teachers have great ideas and have no chance to convert ideas to mobile games.
6. We (developers) took so much from commmunity and we should pay it back. :)

# Concept
